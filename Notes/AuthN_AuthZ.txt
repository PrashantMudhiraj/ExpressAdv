1. OAuth 2.0 
	1.1 Terminology
	    - Resource Owner(me): Entity that can grant access to a protected resource. Typically this is end user.
	    - Client(any app that contact access): Application requesting access to a protected resource on behalf of the Resource Owner
	    - Resource Server(google.contacts.api): Server hosting the protected resources. This is the API you want to access
	    - Authorization Server(accounts.google.com): Server that authenticates the Resource Owner and issues Access Tokens after getting proper authentication. In this case AuthO.
	    - Authorization grant: That proves User approved/granted access for protected resource
	    - Redirect URI : callback url, Once AuthZ done, It will redirect to redirect_uri
	    - Access token: It is a secure, temporary digital key or credential that allows an application to access specific resources (like an API or data) on behalf of a user, without needing their password repeatedly
	    - User Agent: Agent used by the resource owner to interact with the client(example, a brower or a native application)
		- Scope: It defines the specific actions application can be allowed to do on user's behalf
		- Back channel (highly secure channel): Backend server
		- Front channel (less secure channel): Frontend App

	1.2 Flows 
		- Authorization code(front channel + back channel)
		- Implicit(front channel only)

		- Resource owner password credentails(back channel only)
		- Client credentails(back channel only)

2. Problems with OAuth 2.o for authentication
	- No standard way to get the user's information
	- Every implementation is a littel different
	- No common set of scopes

3. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID connect
	- OpenID Connect is for authentication
	- OAuth 2.0 is for authorization
