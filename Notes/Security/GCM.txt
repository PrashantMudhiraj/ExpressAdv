GCM stands for Galois/Counter Mode. It is a "mode of operation" for symmetric key block ciphers (most commonly AES).
In simple terms, GCM is a "two-in-one" technology: it provides Encryption (Secrecy) and Authentication (Integrity) at the same time.
Here is the breakdown of why GCM is the industry standard today:

1. The Two Parts of GCM
    To understand GCM, you have to look at its two components:

    - Counter (the "C" in GCM): 
        - This is the encryption part. It turns the block cipher into a stream cipher by using a counter. This makes it very fast because it can encrypt different parts of the data at the same time (parallel processing).
    - Galois (the "G" in GCM): 
        - This is the mathematical process (using Galois field multiplication) used to create the Authentication Tag (the authTag we discussed earlier). It calculates a mathematical "fingerprint" of the data as it is being encrypted.

2. Why GCM is "AEAD"
    - GCM is categorized as AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data).
    - Before GCM, if you wanted to encrypt a message and make sure it wasn't tampered with, you had to do two separate steps:
        - Encrypt the message (e.g., using AES-CBC).
        - Run the message through a second algorithm to create a signature (e.g., HMAC).
    - GCM does both in one single pass. This is more efficient and less prone to developer errors.

3. Key Characteristics of GCM
    A. The "Auth Tag" is Required
        - Unlike older modes (like CBC), GCM produces an Authentication Tag.
        - If you decrypt the data and the tag doesn't match, GCM tells you immediately.
        - In older modes, you might decrypt a tampered message and get "gibberish" without knowing the message was actually changed by an attacker.

    B. Performance
        - Because the "Counter" mode allows for parallelization, GCM is incredibly fast on modern CPUs. Most modern processors (Intel, AMD, ARM) have built-in hardware instructions (AES-NI) specifically designed to speed up GCM.

    C. The Importance of the IV (Nonce)
        - GCM has one strict rule: Never use the same IV (Initialization Vector) with the same key twice.

- If you reuse an IV/Key pair in GCM, an attacker can perform a mathematical operation to recover the "authentication key" and potentially decrypt your messages.

- This is why, in Node.js, you see crypto.randomBytes(12) used for the IV every time.

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Feature	                    AES-CBC (Old)	                 AES-GCM (Modern)
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Secrecy	                    Yes	                                Yes
        Integrity/Authenticity	    No (Needs a separate HMAC)	        Yes (Built-in via Auth Tag)
        Speed	                    Slower (Sequential)	                Faster (Parallel)
        Tamper Detection	        No	                                Yes
        Standard usage	            Legacy systems	                    TLS 1.2+, HTTPS, SSH, VPNs
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In short: GCM is the "Gold Standard" for modern encryption because it provides the Secrecy of encryption AND the Integrity + Authenticity of a signature in one efficient package.
